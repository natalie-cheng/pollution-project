# Pollution Project: Analyzing US Air Pollution between 2000 and 2016, and Predicting Trends for the next 10 years
## Last Project Update: October 4th 2021

Hello!

This is my Analysis and Prediction of US Pollution Trends Project for my Data Science with Python course with Coderschool.

This project was the first application of the data cleaning and analysis skills I learned throughout the course. I ran this program in a conda envionrment on my laptop, and ultimately transferred it onto a streamlit webpage for presentation (however, the page is now unavailable).

I used publicly sourced data on pollutant levels in the US and analyzed the effects of 4 different air pollutants (NO2, SO2, O3, CO) from 2010 to 2016, with an emphasis on California. 

My final code and streamlit webpage displayed graphs that plotted pollution change, with the user able to select either the time frame (yearly, monthly), the location (the US, California), or the pollutant.

It also produced a graph that ranked the 50 states' levels of pollution, given a particular pollutant (user-chosen).

I also utilized machine learning to produce a prediction model on the levels of each pollutant from 2016 to 2026, both for the US and specifically California.

Finally, I used a publicly sourced geo data file to produce a map of the US with corrosponding state colors based on the level of a particular pollutant (similar to a weather map).

Although the streamlit webpage is no longer available, my code is still viewable. I had a great time with this project!
